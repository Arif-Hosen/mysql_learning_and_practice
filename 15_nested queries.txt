* Nested Query-

-- find names all of employees who have sold more than 30000 to a client

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
    SELECT works_with.emp_id
FROM works_with
WHERE total_sales > 30000
);

-- find the all clients who are handle by the branch that Michael Scott manages. Assume you the Michael's ID
SELECT * 
FROM client
WHERE branch_id = (
    SELECT branch.branch_id 
    from branch
    WHERE branch.mgr_id = 102 LIMIT 1
);

-- Find the names of employees who work with clients handled by the scranton branch
SELECT employee.first_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT works_with.emp_id
    FROM works_with
    WHERE works_with.client_id IN (
        SELECT client.client_id
        FROM client
        WHERE client.branch_id = 2
    )
);

-- another way
SELECT employee.first_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
    SELECT works_with.emp_id
    FROM works_with
) AND employee.branch_id = 2;

-- Find the names of all clients who have spent more than 100,000 dollars
SELECT client.client_name
FROM client
WHERE client.client_id IN (
    SELECT client_id
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(works_with.total_sales) AS totals, client_id
                                    FROM works_with
                                    GROUP BY client_id
    ) AS client_sales
    WHERE client_sales.totals > 100000
);

-- Find the names of all clients who have spent more than 100,000 dollars

SELECT client.client_name
FROM client
WHERE client.client_id IN (
    SELECT client_id 
    FROM (
        SELECT client_id, SUM(works_with.total_sales) as total_spent
        FROM works_with
