* Join
-- Join - is used to combine row from multiple table based on the relation column between them
-- There are 4 join -
-- 1. Inner join - return the values that have matching values in both table
-- 2. Left join - returns the all values from left table and mathced record from the right table
-- 3. RIGHT JOIN - return the all values from the right table and matched record from the left
-- 4. Full Join (does not exists in mysql, we can use Left, right and union operator between them) - return the all values from right and left table

-- INNER JOIN
-- find all branches and their manager name
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON branch.mgr_id = employee.emp_id;

-- Left join
-- find all branches and their manager name
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

-- Right join
-- find all branches and their manager name
SELECT employee.emp_id, branch.branch_name, employee.first_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;


-- full join - using union
SELECT employee.emp_id, branch.branch_name, employee.first_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
UNION
SELECT employee.emp_id, branch.branch_name, employee.first_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
;



INSERT INTO branch VALUES(4, 'Buffelo', null, null);
SELECT * FROM branch;
