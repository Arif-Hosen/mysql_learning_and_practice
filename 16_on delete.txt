-- foreign key constraints - 
-- ON DELETE SET NULL - If we delete any record from parent table, the child table foreign will be setted with null.
-- ON DELETE CASCADE - If we delete any record from parent table, the child table record will be deleled.
--  * note - If a foreign key does not use as a primary key in the child table, we generally use ON DELETE SET NULL and if a foreign key use as a primary key in the child table, 
-- ON DELETE CASCADE will be used.
