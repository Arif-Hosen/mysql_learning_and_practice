WHERE (CITY LIKE "a%"
    OR CITY LIKE "e%"
    OR CITY LIKE "i%"
    OR CITY LIKE "o%"
    OR CITY LIKE "u%")
    AND (
    CITY LIKE "%a"
    OR CITY LIKE "%e"
    OR CITY LIKE "%i"
    OR CITY LIKE "%o"
    OR CITY LIKE "%u"
    );

Way -2:
--------
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';

Explaination:
-------------
Let's break down the regular expression '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$' -

 ->  ^: This symbol represents the start of a line or string.
 -> [aeiou]: This character class matches any single character that is one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'.
 -> .*: This part matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
 -> [aeiou]: Similar to the previous character class, it matches any single vowel character.
 -> $: This symbol represents the end of a line or string.

Putting it all together, the regular expression '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$' matches strings that meet the following conditions:
1. The string starts with a vowel (^[aeiou]).
2. It can have any number of characters in between (.*).
3. The string ends with a vowel ([aeiou]$).
Therefore, the regular expression selects values from the CITY column that start and end with a vowel, allowing for any characters in between.
